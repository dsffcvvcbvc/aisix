# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.7
#
# Multi-stage build for the aisix AI gateway.
#
# The workspace pins rustc via rust-toolchain.toml (currently 1.93.1).
# We use the latest Debian-based official Rust image, then copy the
# single `aisix` binary into a slim runtime image.
#
# BuildKit is required (the `--mount=type=cache` directives rely on
# it). On recent Docker Desktop / Docker CE, BuildKit is the default;
# on older clients run:  DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build -t aisix:dev .
#
# Build:
#   docker build -t aisix:dev .
#   docker build --build-arg PGO=off -t aisix:dev .   # quick local build, skips PGO
#
# Run, standalone (mount your own config):
#   docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/config.example.yaml:/etc/aisix/config.yaml \
#     aisix:dev
#
# Run, managed (connected to Cavora Cloud with env-var overrides):
#   docker run --rm \
#     -e CAVORA_CONFIG_PATH=/etc/aisix/config.managed.yaml \
#     -e CAVORA_MANAGED__CP_BASE_URL \
#     -e CAVORA_MANAGED__CP_ETCD_ENDPOINT \
#     -e CAVORA_MANAGED__CP_CERT_PEM \
#     -e CAVORA_MANAGED__CP_KEY_PEM \
#     -e CAVORA_MANAGED__CP_CA_PEM \
#     -v aisix-mtls:/var/lib/aisix \
#     aisix:dev
# The volume preserves the materialized mTLS bundle and gateway identity across
# container restarts.

# Short git sha stamped into the binary so a running DP can be matched
# to its image tag: release builds report `<version>+sha-<BUILD_SHA>` in
# the heartbeat, every other build reports `dev+sha-<BUILD_SHA>`. CI
# passes the same short sha that tags the image; plain `docker build`
# (no args) produces a binary that reports `dev`.
ARG BUILD_SHA=
ENV CAVORA_BUILD_SHA=$BUILD_SHA

# Release version stamped into the binary. CI derives this from the
# release tag (v0.4.0 → 0.4.0), so `aisix --version`, the `Server`
# response header, and the heartbeat dp_version always self-report the
# tagged version — no manual Cargo.toml bump at release time. Empty on
# non-release builds; see crates/aisix-core/src/version.rs.
ARG BUILD_VERSION=
ENV CAVORA_BUILD_VERSION=$BUILD_VERSION

# BuildKit cache mounts carry `~/.cargo/registry` + `target/` across
# builds, so changes to source files still reuse compiled dependencies.
# We could split dep-build from source-build via a manifests-only warm
# stage, but the cache mounts give us ~95% of the same win with half
# the Dockerfile complexity. Source copy is a single layer.

# `crates/aisix-admin/src/openapi.rs` uses `include_str!` to embed

# Profile-guided optimization gate. The default stays ON so a bare
# `docker build` — a local release rehearsal, a one-off customer image —
# produces the same shape as the published artifact rather than a silently
# un-optimized one; opting out is explicit.
#
# CI inverts that default and passes PGO=on only for a STABLE release tag
# (vX.Y.Z). PR, main/:dev and `-rc.N` builds pass PGO=off: PGO cost ~20 min
# on every one of the ~40 main pushes per release cycle, and none of those
# images are the artifact a customer runs. See "Decide PGO build mode" in
# .github/workflows/docker-image.yml and the PGO section of RELEASING.md.
ARG PGO=on

# `--locked` forces the build to use the exact versions in Cargo.lock —
# fails fast if the lockfile is stale rather than silently resolving
# fresh deps in CI.
#
# PGO=on runs the three-phase build (#967):
#   A. instrumented build (-Cprofile-generate) in its own target dir;
#   B. train.sh drives the committed 12-shape matrix through the
#      instrumented gateway against the trainer's local mock, then merges
#      the .profraw files with the pinned toolchain's own llvm-profdata
#      (llvm-tools-preview — exact LLVM match with rustc, no extra deps);
#   C. optimized build (-Cprofile-use) in a third target dir, so profile
#      builds never share cargo fingerprints with plain builds.
# FAIL-CLOSED: any phase failing fails this RUN and nothing is shipped.
# The proof marker (pgo-verified.json) is written only after phase C
# succeeds; the push workflows assert it before trusting the image.
# The merged profile is content-addressed (merged-<sha>.profdata) because
# cargo fingerprints the -Cprofile-use PATH, not the file content — a
# retrained profile at a fixed path would silently reuse stale artifacts
# from the persistent target cache mount.
#
# linux/arm64 (AISIX-Cloud#903) carries two constraints:
#   - jemalloc bakes the build host's page size into the binary, so a
#     4K-page build aborts at startup on a 64K-page kernel. Building with
#     lg-page 16 yields a binary that runs on both (see
#     crates/aisix-server/src/main.rs). Keyed on TARGETARCH below so a
#     plain `docker build` on an arm64 host is right too, not only CI.
#   - PGO training runs the instrumented binary, so it needs a NATIVE
#     arm64 builder — it cannot self-train under emulation. CI gives each
#     architecture its own runner for that reason; do not reintroduce QEMU.
# Supplied by BuildKit; an absent value trips `set -u` below rather than
# silently producing a 4K-page arm64 binary.
ARG TARGETARCH

# The cache mounts are keyed per architecture. A cache mount's default id is
# its target path, so a single builder asked for both platforms at once
# (`docker build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 .`) would run the two
# stage variants against one `/src/target` — where they share a cargo lock
# and both write `release/cavora`, so the copy below can pick up the other
# architecture's binary.
