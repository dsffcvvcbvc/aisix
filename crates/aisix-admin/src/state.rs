//! Shared axum state for every admin handler.
//!
//! Holds:
//! - the bootstrap-config-provided `admin_keys` (auth)
//! - the `ConfigStore` trait object (CRUD backend)
//! - the session table behind the admin-key → cookie exchange
//! - a `SnapshotHandle` for authenticated operator-health handlers
//!
//! The store is held behind an `Arc<dyn ConfigStore>` so production can
//! wire an etcd-backed impl and tests can use `InMemoryStore` via the
//! same type.
